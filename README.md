# baduk

See the [Main project github page](https://github.com/bunniesandbeatings/go-flavor)

Although intended to support Struct 101 exclusively, I'm going to add DOT or PlantUML output as well

## Run

Binary is called `baduk`

`./scripts/sample` has sample usage (assuming the usual $GOPATH and $PATH settings).

## Contributing


## Assumptions

  * Code is buildable
  * Golang enforces no cycles in imports
